-+      HVAC WORKFLOW TESTING COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND
-+      
-+      🔴 CRITICAL FRONTEND FORM SUBMISSION ISSUE:
-+      
-+      PROBLEM SUMMARY:
-+      - Both login and registration forms render correctly
-+      - All form fields accept data properly (personal info, business info)
-+      - Business owner toggle works and shows HVAC business fields
-+      - Backend APIs work perfectly (verified via curl testing)
-+      - CRITICAL: Form submission buttons are not clickable/functional
-+      
-+      DETAILED FINDINGS:
-+      
-+      ✅ BACKEND VERIFICATION (Working):
-+      - Login API: POST /api/v1/auth/login returns valid tokens
-+      - Registration API: POST /api/v1/auth/register creates HVAC business owners
-+      - Existing user test_hvac_1769226270@example.com verified working
-+      - New HVAC business registration successful via API
-+      
-+      ❌ FRONTEND ISSUES (Broken):
-+      - Submit buttons timeout when clicked (30s timeout exceeded)
-+      - Enter key submission does not work
-+      - Forms stay on same page after submission attempts
-+      - No API calls are made from frontend forms
-+      
-+      IMPACT:
-+      - Users cannot register new HVAC businesses through UI
-+      - Existing users cannot login through UI
-+      - HVAC Hub cannot be tested due to login dependency
-+      
-+      RECOMMENDATION:
-+      Main agent needs to investigate and fix frontend form submission mechanism.
-+      The issue appears to be in the form event handling or button click handlers.

+          - Cannot reach calculator page due to authentication requirement
+

+          ✅ Calculator component exists and is properly implemented
+          ✅ Look Up and Calculate buttons are coded correctly in /app/frontend/app/hvac/calculate.tsx

+      DETAILED ANALYSIS:

+      ✅ WHAT WORKS:
+      - Calculator component exists and is properly implemented (/app/frontend/app/hvac/calculate.tsx)
+      - Look Up and Calculate buttons are coded correctly

+      - Login form submission is broken (confirmed in multiple tests)
+      - "Sign In" button visible but clicks don't trigger form submission

+      - Login form renders correctly and accepts credentials

+      - No API calls are made when button is clicked
+      - Backend logs show successful API authentication when called directly
+      
+      IMPACT ON REQUESTED TESTING:
